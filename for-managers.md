# For Managers

Managers are critically important to the onboarding process, but onboarding new hires is never going to be their full-time role. How do you enable overstretched managers to properly prep and support new employees? It starts with making sure they’re supported. 

Set expectations. Schedule trainings. Collect feedback. Provide checklists and just-in-time nudges when managers need them. These support structures help managers to create a great new hire experience, and ensure that the process you’ve built is actually executed every time.

How does a team do this in a scalable way? Toast built out a manager-specific wiki that introduces managers to the onboarding process and clearly outlines their responsibilities. It spells out why managers are critically important to the productivity and success of their new hires, and includes specific checklists and contacts. Every hiring manager receives a copy of this wiki before their new hire starts, and members of the engineering onboarding team periodically check in to answer questions, collect feedback, and provide tangible support.

## Toast's Manager Wiki

Congratulations on your new hire! Our goal is to deliver a world-class onboarding experience to ramp engineers as efficiently as possible, and to ensure that everyone who joins is delighted to be a part of our team. You’re a critical part of that effort.

Why? Research has demonstrated a clear correlation between comprehensive onboarding and engagement, retention, and long-term productivity. Case in point: Forbes found that new hires who go through a structured onboarding process are 58% more likely to remain with the company after 3 years.

As a hiring manager, you’re responsible for every person you bring onto your team. We have a number of resources and processes in place to help you be successful that we’re outlining here. Know that we’re continuing to invest in this toolkit as we grow, and we welcome your feedback.

**Your Goal**
* To ramp your new hire as quickly and comprehensively as possible. This means:
* Setting clear goals for their first 30/60/90 days on the team, and supporting them in hitting those goals
* Collecting 360 feedback from the new hire, their onboarding buddy, and others on the team to spot red flags, overcome challenges, and help improve onboarding processes for future new hires
* End the 90-day onboarding period with a  ramped new hire and a positive engagement score

**Your Responsibilities**
In order to achieve your goal of ramping your new hire quickly and comprehensively, we’ll be asking you to assume a number of responsibilities. These include:
* [Building a customized onboarding plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F3PkIuN1oGIY6tUOUGSfS1vFDZLw_Ie-3bz2VwQD7kk/edit#gid=1884255390) for your new hire, which will serve as their primary source for onboarding responsibilities for the first 90 days.

* Identifying 30/60/90 day goals for your new hire, and meeting monthly to ensure they’re on track. You’ll also be conducting an informal first performance review at 90 days.
* Assigning a buddy to support your new hire throughout the onboarding process. You’re responsible for clearly communicating expectations and responsibilities to the buddy.
* NEW Working together with the dev buddy to ensure that the new hire ships code in their first week. Make sure the task is realistic (tip: try it yourself!)
* [for teams using Donut]: Donut is our friendly onboarding Slack robot! Please keep an eye out in Slack; we’ll be sending important information and reminders via Donut, and collecting valuable data.
* Give us feedback on the process! We’re always iterating, and want to make it the best experience possible for all involved.

**Your Support Team**
You’re not in this alone! You’ll have an entire support team working alongside you to answer questions and help to provide an enriching new hire experience. Here’s a peek into who’s doing what:
