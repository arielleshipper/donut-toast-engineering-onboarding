#  The Why

##  How to Get Them From First Day to First Commit
A playbook for ramping new eng hires in record time from [Donut](http://www.donut.com) and [Toast](http://www.post.toasttab.com).

What makes for a successful new hire? There are three key indicators: engagement, retention, and productivity. Ultimately, all three impact your ability to succeed and the business’s bottom line. Optimizing for all three outcomes starts with onboarding. Good onboarding sets new hires up for success by enabling fast learning, integrating them into the team socially, and setting a clear definition for what success looks like.
One particularly important metric for engineering teams is time to productivity. The [“productivity tax”](https://www.cgsinc.com/blog/measure-onboarding-effectiveness-with-employee-time-to-productivity) as new hires ramp up is a universal challenge. Onboarding can cost [$4,000-$7,000](https://medium.com/@kristenmaeve/the-cost-of-not-onboarding-your-new-hire-5ba94d83c57c) per employee—multiply that by the number of new hires you’re adding per year, and any incremental decreases in ramp time or increases in productivity can make a huge difference.

###“Organizations with a standard onboarding process experience 50% greater new hire productivity.” - [SHRM](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/dont-underestimate-the-importance-of-effective-onboarding.aspx)

Perhaps the most important time for structured onboarding is a phase of rapid growth, especially when engineering teams are spread across multiple offices or working on a fully distributed team. Scattered, chaotic initiatives don’t scale. Well-defined processes with strategic planning behind them do. So what does a scalable, structured onboarding process for engineers look like? Toast is a rapidly growing company whose mission is to help restaurants do what they love and thrive. As Toast’s engineering team entered an explosive growth phase across two offices (HQ in Boston and a second office in Dublin), their leadership team knew they’d have to build a rock-solid process that was designed to keep pace with the growth rate of the team, and to get engineers shipping code as quickly as possible. Here are some insights, tips, and templates from their onboarding process, designed specifically to ramp engineers quickly and effectively.

_Some questions to ask yourself about onboarding:_
* Are there any processes in place for new engineers today?
* What has the feedback on the new hire experience been (if any)?
* How did you feel when you first joined the company? What did you like, and what resources or support do you wish had existed?
