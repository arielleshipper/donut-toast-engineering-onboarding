# The Building Blocks of Onboarding
## Onboarding is a team sport. This is your playbook.

All great onboarding processes start with a plan. That’s obvious. But how do you design an engineering-specific onboarding program that works?

Just like the product design process, you’ll want to start with a bit of research:
* Ask current and recent new hires about their experience. How ramped do they feel? What’s been helpful? What could have improved their experience?
* Talk to eng managers—find out how they think their new hires are ramping, and where the gaps exist. Dig into why those gaps exist, and what kind of support is needed to fill them.
* Sync up with your HR or People Ops team (if you have one). Find out what they cover during their onboarding process, and decide on a natural transition point into complementary role-specific training.
* Are there any other stakeholders that you can involve? Can you create a new-hire task force within the Product-Design-Engineering team?

Regardless of what your research uncovers, there are a few foundational onboarding building blocks that make engineers feel welcome, supported, and able to learn quickly:
* 90-day onboarding plan for all stakeholders
* First ship/quick win project
* Learning curriculum
* Dev buddy program
* SaaS tool stack for support and automation

While a mature onboarding process will have many or most of these foundational building blocks, you might be starting from scratch—and that’s okay. Just as Rome wasn’t built in a day, Toast built their onboarding process over time, and they’re still iterating based on both qualitative feedback and quantitative results. 

Toast’s MVP was a giant Google doc where they could track tasks. The Google doc eventually evolved into scripts that streamlined setting up the dev environment, and a wiki page specifically for managers. Today, Toast has a sophisticated program complete with customized learning journeys, automated delivery of info and tasks to all stakeholders right in Slack, and a program for improving onboarding over time .

Some questions to ask yourself about prioritizing implementation of building blocks:
* Do we have any of these foundational building blocks in play today?
* Which of these building blocks will have the least resistance to implementation?
* Which of these building blocks has the potential for the highest ROI for the effort?
* Have new hires or managers specifically requested any of these building blocks?
* Are there any gaps we identified through research that could be filled by one of these building blocks?
